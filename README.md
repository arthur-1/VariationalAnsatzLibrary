# Variational Ansatz Library (VAL)

A Python module for working with parameterized quantum circuits. This provides an abstraction enabling rapid development
 of algorithms working with quantum circuits. 
 
**NOTE:** This project is a work in progress, and depends on a fork of Qiskit Aqua. The project will be integrated with
 the release version of Qiskit Aqua in the near future.
 
At the moment, the bulk of the logic is found in: `./src/ansatz/ansatz.py`.
 
## Todo: 
 - Create setup script.
 - List requirements/ dependencies.
 - Implement tests.
 - Improve documentation.
 - Add list for planned features.
